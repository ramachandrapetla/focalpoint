                <p>Allison is a writer who loves all things digital marketing and WordPress. 
                    When sheâ€™s not writing you can find her curled up with a good mystery book, 
                    eating cheese, and spending time with her dog, Splinter (yes, like Master Splinter from the Ninja Turtles).</p>
